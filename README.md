## Deployment
The webgame is deployed at https://azvice.github.io/Milestone-project/

## Project Description
I'm building a slot machine, random numbers pulled me towards this task. I always wondered if the slot machines outcomes at casinos are actually random, so I thought I build one to answer my question. 

## Game Logic

  Rules of the game: Press the SPIN button to play and gain credits, if you hit a jackpot you've won the game. 
  The game works by using the Math.random() in combination with Math.floor with both methods and a bit of math a random number can be selected. 
  The game is easy to play, press the SPIN!! button and have some fun.
